Welcome to the educational robotics lecture using Arduino, Robduino module, and Fischertechnik parts! In this lectures, we will learn how to use these tools and materials to build and program simple robots for educational and recreational purposes.

First, we will introduce the Arduino controller and the Robduino module, and discuss their capabilities and limitations. We will also cover the basics of the Arduino programming language, including variables, functions, and control structures.

Next, we will discuss the Fischertechnik parts and how they can be used to construct robots with various shapes, sizes, and capabilities. We will cover the different types of parts that are available, such as beams, gears, motors, and sensors, and how they can be combined to create a wide range of structures and mechanisms.

We will then demonstrate how to use the Arduino controller and Robduino shield to program and control Fischertechnik robots. We will cover topics such as sensor input, actuator output, and feedback control.

Throughout this lecture, we will use hands-on activities and examples to illustrate the concepts and techniques that are covered. We will also discuss some of the challenges and considerations that are involved in building and programming robots with these tools and materials.

## Construction parts

Fischertechnik and LEGO are both brands of construction toy systems that allow users to build and create a wide range of structures and mechanisms. Both systems use a modular approach, with a variety of interlocking parts that can be easily snapped together.

However, there are some key differences between Fischertechnik and LEGO parts:

Material: Fischertechnik parts are made of a durable, high-quality plastic called polycarbonate, which is known for its strength and resistance to wear and tear. LEGO parts are made of a softer plastic called acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), which is more flexible and less durable.

Precision: Fischertechnik parts are designed with high precision and tolerances, which allows for more accurate and stable constructions. LEGO parts have slightly looser tolerances, which can make them more prone to wobbling or sagging.

Size and shape: Fischertechnik parts are generally smaller and more compact than LEGO parts, which allows for more detailed and precise constructions. LEGO parts are larger and more blocky, which makes them more suitable for building larger structures.

Functionality: Fischertechnik parts are designed with a focus on mechanical and electrical functionality, and include a wide range of components such as gears, motors, and sensors. LEGO parts are more geared towards aesthetics and playability, and include elements such as minifigures and decorative elements.

Price: Fischertechnik parts tend to be more expensive than LEGO parts, due to their higher quality and greater functionality.

Overall, Fischertechnik and LEGO are both excellent construction toy systems, and the choice between them will depend on the specific needs and preferences of the user.
