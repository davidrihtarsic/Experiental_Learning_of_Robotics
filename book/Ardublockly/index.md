# Early learning of Robotics


Using Ardublockly in early robotics courses is useful for several reasons:

1. Visual Programming: Ardublockly allows students to create programs for the robot using a visual programming interface. This makes it easier for beginners to understand programming concepts and to quickly develop working programs.

2. Easy to Learn: Since Ardublockly is based on Blockly, which is a drag-and-drop programming language, students can easily learn how to use the interface and create programs without the need for extensive coding knowledge.

3. Customizable: With Ardublockly, students can easily customize their programs by adding their own blocks, variables, and functions. This makes it easy for them to experiment with different programming concepts and see the results of their code in real-time.

4. Low Cost: Ardublockly is free and runs on affordable hardware like the Arduino platform. This makes it easy for schools and educators to implement robotics courses without breaking the bank.

Overall, Ardublockly is a great tool for teaching robotics to beginners. It allows students to easily learn programming concepts while experimenting with their own ideas and customizing their programs.
