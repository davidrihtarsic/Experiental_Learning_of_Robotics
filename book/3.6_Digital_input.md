 Digital input
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> to-do

1. Push Button: a push button can be used to trigger a digital input. By connecting a push button to an Arduino digital pin and writing a sketch to register when the button is pressed, digital input can be used to trigger an action. 

2. Touch Sensor: a touch sensor can be used to detect contact with a particular surface and can act as a digital input. By connecting the sensor to an Arduino digital pin and writing a sketch to listen for contact, digital input can be used to trigger an action.

3. Light Sensor: a light sensor can be used to detect light levels and can act as a digital input. By connecting the sensor to an Arduino digital pin and writing a sketch to listen for changes in light levels, digital input can be used to trigger an action."
