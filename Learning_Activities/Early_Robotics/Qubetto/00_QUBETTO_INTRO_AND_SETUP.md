 QUBETTO INTRO AND SETUP
================================================================================

1. What Is Cubetto?
Cubetto is a friendly wooden robot designed to introduce children to the basics of coding and problem-solving. Children create simple programs by arranging colored blocks on a control board, then pressing “Go.” Cubetto follows the directions they’ve laid out.

2. Main Components
Cubetto Robot – A wooden cube on wheels.
Control Board – A wooden board with slots for coding blocks.
Colored Blocks – Each color represents an action (move forward, turn left, turn right, function call).
Mat or Play Surface – Often a grid mat with thematic imagery to inspire storytelling.

3. How It Works
Place the Blocks: Put the colored blocks on the control board in the desired order.
Press Go: Cubetto follows the sequence of instructions.
Observe and Learn: Children see firsthand how each command corresponds to movement.

4. Teacher Tips
Encourage children to predict Cubetto’s path.
Use short sequences at first, then let them experiment with longer ones.
Treat mistakes as part of the learning: “We found a bug—how can we fix it?”

5. Setup Checklist
Ensure the batteries in Cubetto are charged or fresh.
Clear a small area on the floor or table.
Have the control board, colored blocks, and thematic map laid out where everyone can see.
