 INNOVATIVE PROJECT
================================================================================

1. Learning Objectives
Encourage creativity and storytelling.
Reinforce both basic moves and function usage.
Introduce open-ended problem-solving.

2. Materials
Cubetto robot, control board, all blocks (including function block).
A “story mat” (e.g., a city map, a space map, or a homemade mat drawn by children).
Optional: Paper, markers, stickers for decoration.

3. Project Description
Story Setup

Explain a theme or story prompt (e.g., “Cubetto is an explorer visiting four interesting spots on the map!”).
Planning (5–10 minutes)

Have children pick which spots Cubetto needs to visit.
They draw or color small pictures (treasure chests, stars, trees) at different locations.
Coding the Path (5–10 minutes)

Encourage them to create at least one function. For example, a “dance move” or “spiral turn.”
Sequence out how Cubetto will move from one location to another in the story.
Share & Discuss (5 minutes)

Let children show each other the “adventure path” and watch Cubetto follow it.
Invite them to explain how their function block helped them shorten the code.

4. Extension Ideas
Add obstacles or “detours” on the mat and see if they can adapt their code.
Let them name their function (e.g., “The Explorer Dance”).

5. Conclusion
Celebrate how far the children have come: from simple forward/turn commands to reusing a function in a bigger story.
Emphasize that they have effectively learned the basics of coding logic at a young age.
