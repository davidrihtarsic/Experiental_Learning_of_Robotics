 ROBOTICS HARDWARE
================================================================================

When we think of robots, the first image that often comes to mind is the robotic arm. This is no coincidenceâ€”robotic arms dominate industrial automation, performing tasks such as welding, assembly, and material handling with precision and efficiency. According to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), industrial robots (primarily robotic arms) accounted for over 70% of all robot installations worldwide in recent years, highlighting their importance in manufacturing and production lines.

However, mobile robots are rapidly gaining ground. From autonomous warehouse robots to self-driving vehicles and planetary rovers, mobile robotics is becoming a key player in logistics, healthcare, and exploration. With advancements in artificial intelligence and sensor technology, these robots are no longer confined to structured environments but can adapt to dynamic, real-world conditions.

As we explore robotic hardware, we will see how both stationary and mobile robotic systems rely on a combination of mechanics, electronics, and control systems to interact with their environment.
