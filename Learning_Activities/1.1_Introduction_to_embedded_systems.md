 Introduction to embedded systems
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Embedded systems are specialized computing devices engineered to perform dedicated functions within larger systems. Unlike general-purpose computers, these devices combine hardware—typically microprocessors or microcontrollers—with software (commonly called firmware) to execute specific tasks reliably and efficiently. Their design is tailored to meet the precise demands of applications ranging from consumer electronics to industrial control systems.

Embedded systems are specialized computing devices designed for dedicated functions, ubiquitous in our daily lives and production processes (Cai, 2023; Qian et al., 2009). These systems consist of hardware, including microprocessors or microcontrollers, and software, often referred to as firmware (Qian et al., 2009). Embedded systems are characterized by their application-specific nature, reliance on computer technology, and customizable software and hardware (Cai, 2023). They are integral components of larger systems, such as robots, unmanned vehicles, and aerospace electronics (Sadiku et al., 2017). Embedded systems can be classified into two types: visible and invisible to users (Barkalov et al., 2019). The embedded systems market is rapidly growing, particularly in wireless and web applications (Qian et al., 2009). As technology advances, embedded systems continue to evolve, with emerging trends shaping their future development and wider adoption across various domains (Cai, 2023). Understanding embedded systems is crucial for leveraging their capabilities in an increasingly interconnected and technologically empowered future.

In the context of electronics projects, the term "embedded systems" is frequently mentioned because these systems are closely intertwined with the work of electronics. Many electronics projects inherently require the integration of both hardware circuitry and computational intelligence. For instance, when designing a sensor module or an actuator controller, engineers not only need to consider the physical electronic components but also how to process data and execute control algorithms. Embedded systems provide that bridge between raw electronics and smart functionality, making them an essential aspect of modern electronics projects. This overlap ensures that innovations in electronics are increasingly empowered by embedded computing, leading to more robust, efficient, and intelligent systems.

By including embedded systems in our discussion, we acknowledge their pivotal role in the evolution of electronics projects. Their inherent synergy fosters a collaborative approach where hardware design and software development merge, enabling the creation of sophisticated systems that address real-world challenges effectively.
