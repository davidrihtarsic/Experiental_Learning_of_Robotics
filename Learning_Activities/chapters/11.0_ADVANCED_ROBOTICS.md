 Robotics in artificial intelligence and machine learning
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This exercise introduces students to the concept of a simple neuron using a line follower robot. We'll start by creating a basic neuron model with input from a light sensor and output to a PWM-controlled LED. 

To understand the basic function of a neuron and how it can be used to control an output device, like an LED, in response to sensor input. This lays the groundwork for understanding how a group of neurons can control a robot.


### Steps

1. **Setup the Circuit**

   - Connect the light sensor to analog pin `A0`.
   - Connect the LED to digital pin `D6` (PWM capable), with a $220 \Omega$ resistor in series.
   - Make sure to common the ground and supply rail of the breadboard with the Arduino.

2. **Write the Arduino Code**

The library `neural_network.h` can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/davidrihtarsic/Experiental_Learning_of_Robotics/blob/main/Learning_Activities/ExperientialRobotics/examples/111_neuron/neural_network.h)

   ```cpp
    #include "neural_network.h"
    const int LIGHT_INPUT_PIN = A0;
    const int OUTPUT_PIN = 6;
    
    Neuron my_first_neuron(LIGHT_INPUT_PIN, -0.5, OUTPUT_PIN);
    
    void setup() {
    }
    
    void loop() {
      Left_neuron.update();
      delay(100);
    }
   ```

3. **Experiment and Observe**

   - Place different light sources or cover the light sensor to observe how the LED's brightness changes in response.
   - Discuss how this mirrors the function of a simple neuron, where the input (light sensor) influences the output (LED brightness).

4. **Extensions**

   - Replace the LED with a motor to simulate the neuron influencing a motor's speed for robot movement.
   - Use two neurons: one for each motor, and discuss how this setup can control a line-following robot.

### Conclusion

Through this exercise, students gain a foundational understanding of how simple neurons work by transforming input data into an actionable output. By relating this to a line follower robot, they can see a practical application of AI concepts in robotics. This hands-on approach enhances grasping the dynamic nature of artificial intelligence and its real-world implementations.
