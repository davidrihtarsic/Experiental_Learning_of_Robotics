 Introduction to embedded systems
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Embedded systems are specialized computing devices engineered to perform dedicated functions within larger systems. Unlike general-purpose computers, these devices combine hardware—typically microprocessors or microcontrollers—with software (commonly called firmware) to execute specific tasks reliably and efficiently. Their design is tailored to meet the precise demands of applications ranging from consumer electronics to industrial control systems.

Embedded systems are specialized computing devices designed for dedicated functions, ubiquitous in our daily lives and production processes (Cai, 2023; Qian et al., 2009). These systems consist of hardware, including microprocessors or microcontrollers, and software, often referred to as firmware (Qian et al., 2009). Embedded systems are characterized by their application-specific nature, reliance on computer technology, and customizable software and hardware (Cai, 2023). They are integral components of larger systems, such as robots, unmanned vehicles, and aerospace electronics (Sadiku et al., 2017). Embedded systems can be classified into two types: visible and invisible to users (Barkalov et al., 2019). The embedded systems market is rapidly growing, particularly in wireless and web applications (Qian et al., 2009). As technology advances, embedded systems continue to evolve, with emerging trends shaping their future development and wider adoption across various domains (Cai, 2023). Understanding embedded systems is crucial for leveraging their capabilities in an increasingly interconnected and technologically empowered future.

In the context of electronics projects, the term "embedded systems" is frequently mentioned because these systems are closely intertwined with the work of electronics. Many electronics projects inherently require the integration of both hardware circuitry and computational intelligence. For instance, when designing a sensor module or an actuator controller, engineers not only need to consider the physical electronic components but also how to process data and execute control algorithms. Embedded systems provide that bridge between raw electronics and smart functionality, making them an essential aspect of modern electronics projects. This overlap ensures that innovations in electronics are increasingly empowered by embedded computing, leading to more robust, efficient, and intelligent systems.

By including embedded systems in our discussion, we acknowledge their pivotal role in the evolution of electronics projects. Their inherent synergy fosters a collaborative approach where hardware design and software development merge, enabling the creation of sophisticated systems that address real-world challenges effectively.

Through robotics, students have the opportunity to explore the world around them, to tinker and construct their own learning, and to develop a deeper understanding of complex topics."

#### Definition of the robots in education

Slangen:  
Definition of the robot must be based
on the main operation that robot performs:

- zaznavanje (angl. Sensing),
- sklepanje (angl. Reasoning) &
- delovanje (angl. Acting).

This operation is constantly executing in a.k.a. S-R-A loop.

Slo. nat. curriculum:`Robotics in Engineering`  
- almost exact interpretation of S-R-A loop
Krmiljenje s povratnim delovanje (angl. feedback control regulation)

- including learning objective:
...kjer učenci ugotovijo potrebe po
**krmiljenju s povratnim delovanjem**
in izpostavijo pomanjkljivosti, če takega krmiljenja ni.

(angl. where students identify the need for
**feedback control** and point out shortcomings
in the absence of such control)

- misconception:
Playing with robots or using a robot is robotics.

- Robots are meant to be user friendly.

#### Robotics in Schools

- very popular in last decade

We can find robots in learning process as:

1. Robotics curses:
  - Electronics
  - Computer Science
  - Engineering
2. motivation for learning other disciplines:
  - Science
  - Technology
  - Engineering
  - Math

#### Important educational impacts

##### LEARNING by DOING

... learning as “BUILDING KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURES” through progressive internalization of actions... this HAPPENS especially felicitously in a context where the LEARNER is consciously engaged in CONSTRUCTING A PUBLIC ENTITY, whether it’s a sand castle on the beach or a theory of the universe. (Papert, S. (1980). Mindstorms. Children, Computers and Powerful Ideas. New York: Basic books.)

##### PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS

Applying knowledge and skills learned into a `public entity` make us proud of ourself. We have something to show to people that matters to us (friends, parents, classmates).

##### CREATIVITY

There is not an only one solution to the problem. Kids can explore their ideas and put it to the test.

##### LEARNING from MISTAKES

Kids are ALLOWED to LEARN from MISTAKES!?! In general, MISTAKES has very bad reputation in school sistem. To degree, that kids are often afraid to give an answer so as not to make a mistake (-> they stop trying). However, Robotics is so complicated field that mistakes can not be avoided. Thus, MISTAKES are very common thing in this learning proces of robotics.

##### CRITICAL THINKING

Critical thinking is ability to do analysis of facts and form objective judgments based on reasonable arguments.

##### SELF-ASSESSMENT

Kids are able to see if they fulfill the intended task or not. They can asses their own performance based on results of intended tasks.
<!--
It is quite difficult to asses ourself if we are well qualified in some topic. Remember: Dunning-Kruger effect: Confidence(Competence)

##### ICT LITERACY

European commission is warning for several years now that EU has large lack in computer science and ICT professionals. Only 55% of computer science and ICT jobs in EU are filled with relevant experts.

#### How to teach robotics?

- Is learning robotics difficult?
    + No and Yes

##### HOW DO WE THINK?

- [Kolb's Learning Cycle](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325475416/figure/fig1/AS:643699918766080@1530481428256/Kolbs-learning-cycle-and-experiential-learning-styles.png)

- [Thinking, Fast and Slow, by Daniel Kahneman](./slike/ThinkingFastSlow.png)

##### HOW DO WE CONSTRUCT OUR KNOWLEDGE?

Piaget (ConstructiVisem):  
Children must be actively engaged to encounter
the experiences necessary to build and adapt their schema.

We need to set up these experiences for our learners.

Papert (ConstructioNism):  
Constructionism—the N word as opposed to the V word — shares
contructivism’s view of learning as “building knowledge structures”
through progressive internalization of actions… It then adds the
idea that this happens especially felicitously in a context where
the learner is consciously engaged in constructing a public entity,
whether it’s a sand castle on the beach or a theory of the universe
( Papert, 1991, p.1)

 Robotics Equipment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fischertechnik and LEGO are both brands of construction toy systems that allow users to build and create a wide range of structures and mechanisms. Both systems use a modular approach, with a variety of interlocking parts that can be easily snapped together.

However, there are some key differences between Fischertechnik and LEGO parts:

Material: Fischertechnik parts are made of a durable, high-quality plastic called polycarbonate, which is known for its strength and resistance to wear and tear. LEGO parts are made of a softer plastic called acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), which is more flexible and less durable.

Precision: Fischertechnik parts are designed with high precision and tolerances, which allows for more accurate and stable constructions. LEGO parts have slightly looser tolerances, which can make them more prone to wobbling or sagging.

Size and shape: Fischertechnik parts are generally smaller and more compact than LEGO parts, which allows for more detailed and precise constructions. LEGO parts are larger and more blocky, which makes them more suitable for building larger structures.

Functionality: Fischertechnik parts are designed with a focus on mechanical and electrical functionality, and include a wide range of components such as gears, motors, and sensors. LEGO parts are more geared towards aesthetics and playability, and include elements such as minifigures and decorative elements.

Price: Fischertechnik parts tend to be more expensive than LEGO parts, due to their higher quality and greater functionality.

Overall, Fischertechnik and LEGO are both excellent construction toy systems, and the choice between them will depend on the specific needs and preferences of the user.
