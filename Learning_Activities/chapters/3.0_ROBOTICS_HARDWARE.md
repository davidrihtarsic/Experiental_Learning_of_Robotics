 ROBOTICS HARDWARE
================================================================================

When we think of robots, the first image that often comes to mind is the robotic arm. This is no coincidence—robotic arms dominate industrial automation, performing tasks such as welding, assembly, and material handling with precision and efficiency. According to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), industrial robots (primarily robotic arms) accounted for over 70% of all robot installations worldwide in recent years, highlighting their importance in manufacturing and production lines.

However, mobile robots are rapidly gaining ground. From autonomous warehouse robots to self-driving vehicles and planetary rovers, mobile robotics is becoming a key player in logistics, healthcare, and exploration. With advancements in artificial intelligence and sensor technology, these robots are no longer confined to structured environments but can adapt to dynamic, real-world conditions.

As we explore robotic hardware, we will see how both stationary and mobile robotic systems rely on a combination of mechanics, electronics, and control systems to interact with their environment.

 Overview of different types of robots
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Robotics is a diverse field that encompasses a wide range of machines designed to perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. Robots can be classified based on their structure, application, mobility, and control mechanisms. Below is a detailed breakdown of the different types of robots commonly used in industry, research, and everyday applications.  

---

### Classification by Mobility

One of the most fundamental ways to categorize robots is based on how they move and interact with their environment.  

#### Stationary Robots (Fixed Robots): 

These robots are anchored in place and perform tasks within a limited workspace. They are primarily used in industrial settings and rely on precise control systems.

title: Actuator

## Motor as main actuator

A DC motor (Direct Current motor) is an electrical machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. It works by using electromagnetic principles to generate rotary motion.

Here is how a DC motor works in more detail:

- The DC motor has two main parts: the stator and the rotor. The stator is the stationary part of the motor, and the rotor is the rotating part.
- The stator consists of a coil of wire that is wound around a core. When an electric current flows through the coil, it creates a magnetic field around the core.
- The rotor consists of a permanent magnet or a coil of wire that is mounted on a shaft. When the rotor is placed inside the stator, the magnetic fields of the stator and the rotor interact with each other.
- If the stator's coil is energized with a DC current, the magnetic field it creates will rotate around the core. This causes the rotor to rotate as well, since it is attracted to the moving magnetic field.
- The speed and direction of the rotor's rotation can be controlled by adjusting the strength and polarity of the current flowing through the stator's coil. This is typically done using an H-bridge circuit, which allows the current to be reversed and the motor to run in both directions.

### Task: Wire a DC motor to a battery

1. Connect the DC motor to the battery and make it run.
2. You can try different combinations to connect the terminals of the motor like:
    - \+ and -
    - \- and +
    - \- and -
    - \+ and +.

![DC motor connection.](./slike/Electric_current_DC_motor.png)

### Questions:

1.  In which direction the motor\'s shaft spins in different situations?
2.  In which direction the electric current flow?
3.  Why does motor is not spinning when both connectors are connected to +
    terminal of the battery?

### Summary
The rotation of the DC motor depends on the direction of electric
current.

### Issues
#### *When I connect the DC motor to + and - terminals of the battery the motor\'s shaft does not spin.*

Check the voltage of the battery... battery may be discharged.  
Check the connectors of the motor... may be bad.

## DC motor control with digital outputs

### Task: Control the DC motor with controller

1. Connect the DC motor to Digital Output D7 and D6.
2. Write the program and check all the combinations of digital outputs;
    00, 01, 10 and 11. First combination is shown in [@lst:190_DC_Motor_Control_with_Digital_Outputs]

```cpp
void setup()
{
  pinMode(7, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(6, OUTPUT);
  // D7=0, D6=0 Že če je to ok je vse ok
  digitalWrite(7, LOW);
  digitalWrite(0, LOW);
  delay(3000);
  // Write other combinations here...

}
void loop()
{

}
```
: DC Motor Control with Digital Outputs. {#lst:190_DC_Motor_Control_with_Digital_Outputs}

3.  For each combination of digital outputs mark the state of the motor (fulfill the [@tbl:motor_combo ]).

| D7 | D6 | Motor rotation |
|:--:|:--:|----------------|
|  0 |  0 |                |
|  0 |  1 |                |
|  1 |  0 |                |
|  1 |  1 |                |

Table: All combinations of the states of motor's connectors. {#tbl:motor_combo}

### Questions:

2.  Try to stop the shaft of the DC motor for a short time and try to remember how difficult it is?
3.  Why does motors' shaft not spinning if the digital output state are  `1` and `1`.

![Wireing the DC motor to controller.](./slike/Controlling_the_motor.png)

### Summary

The motor\'s shaft is spinning according to the direction of the
electric current trough the motor.  
The torque is weak.

title: Gear reducer
nav_order: 4

## Gear reducer

Gear reduction is the process of using a set of gears to reduce the speed of a mechanical system while increasing the torque (rotational force). It is commonly used in robotics and other applications where it is necessary to trade speed for power.

There are several ways to achieve gear reduction, but the most common method is to use a gear train, which is a series of interconnected gears that transmit motion from one gear to another. By using gears with different sizes and ratios, it is possible to reduce the speed of the output gear while increasing the torque.

For example, consider a simple gear train with two gears: a larger driving gear (Gear A) and a smaller driven gear (Gear B). If the driving gear has 10 teeth and the driven gear has 20 teeth, the gear reduction ratio will be 2:1 (Gear B will rotate at half the speed of Gear A, but with twice the torque).

Here is the [@eq:grr] for calculating the gear reduction ratio:

$$ R =  \frac{N_1}{N_2} $${#eq:grr}

where:

- R is gear ratio or often called `mechanical advantage`,
- $N_1$ is number of teeth on driving gear and
- $N_2$ is number of teeth on driven gear.

### Task: Use reductor on a DC motor shaft

1. Add geared reductor to DC motor.
2. Try to stop the shaft of the geared reductor and compare your fillings with the stopping the motor shaft.

![Adding the reductor to the motor.](./slike/reductor.png)

### Questions:

1.  How difficult is to stop the shaft of the reductor in comparison to motor shaft?
2.  How fast the shaft of the reductor is spinning in comparison to the shaft of the motor?
3.  Are you able to freely rotate the shaft of the reductor by hand?
4.  What happened with the produced mechanical power?
5.  Try to calculate the geared ratio of the reductor.

![Gear ration calculation.](./slike/gear_ratio.png)

### Summary

#### Gear ratio

The gear ratio describing the ratio between the angular velocity of
input gear G1 and angular velocity of output gear G2 (see [@eq:mech_adv_angVel]).

$$ { i=\frac{\omega_1}{\omega_2} }. $${#eq:mech_adv_angVel}

Because each gear moves tooth per tooth and if two touching gears have different numbers of teeths their\'s angular velocity will be different.
In fact the anguar velocity will be inversely proportional as [@eq:mech_adv_opt] suggests:

$$ {\frac{\omega_1}{\omega_2}=\frac{N_2}{N_1}=i}. $${#eq:mech_adv_opt}

### Issues

#### *The reductor\'s shaft is not spinning although the DC motor is working properly.*

Check if the reductor is attached all the way to the motor. 
Check if the worm gear of the motor is in contact with first gear of the
roductor.

## Robot construction

Building a functional robot is a crucial step in understanding robotics hardware. In this learning unit, we will focus on assembling a mobile robot using **Fischertechnik** components, a modular construction system widely used in robotics education.  

**Why Fischertechnik?**  

Fischertechnik is a **high-quality, engineering-focused construction system** designed to teach mechanical and technical principles. Unlike simpler building kits, such as LEGO, Fischertechnik provides **greater mechanical accuracy and modularity**, making it ideal for robotics prototyping.  

- **Mechanical Stability** – The system uses interlocking parts that provide excellent structural integrity, ensuring that robots remain durable even in moving applications.  
- **Precision and Functionality** – Fischertechnik components include gears, axles, sensors, and motors, allowing students to construct robots that function similarly to real-world industrial machines.  
- **Realistic Engineering Design** – Unlike snap-together toys, Fischertechnik encourages **engineering-oriented thinking**, requiring students to assemble parts in ways that mimic professional robotics design.  
- **Integration with Electronics** – Fischertechnik models can incorporate **microcontrollers (e.g., RobDuino, Arduino)** and sensors, bridging the gap between mechanical assembly and programming.  
- **Flexibility for Modifications** – The modular nature of the system allows for easy redesigns and upgrades, making it perfect for experimentation.  

By using Fischertechnik, students **develop hands-on problem-solving skills**, reinforce their understanding of mechanics, and gain practical experience in constructing **stable, functional robotic systems**.  

In the next steps, you will **follow a structured assembly guide** to construct your first mobile robot, install its power source, and integrate the **RobDuino controller**, which will later be programmed to perform autonomous tasks.

### Task: Assemble robot construction

1. Construct the mobile robot according to this sequences on the [@fig:construction].

![Construction sequences.](./slike/free_whelly.png){#fig:construction}

Or you can follow the video [instructions](https://youtu.be/bybqvos4xYk)

2. Add the battery between the red cornered bricks. The connector shuld
    be pointing to the back of the robot.
3. Add also the RobDuino controller. Clip the controller between the grey upstanding bricks.

### Questions:

1.  Where do you think is th front side of the robot?
2.  Are you able to rotate the wheels freely by hand?

### Summary:
<++>

### Issues:

### **Issues:**  

**Incorrect Height Adjustment of the Rear Support Wheel**  
   - Ensure that the **rear support wheel is positioned at the correct height** so that its **rotation axis remains perfectly vertical**.  
   - An incorrect height may cause **unwanted tilting**, leading to unstable movement.  

**Misalignment of Wheels and Axles**  
   - Check that the **driving wheels** are **securely attached** and properly aligned with the chassis.  
   - A misaligned axle can cause uneven movement or excessive friction, reducing efficiency.  

**Loose or Improperly Fastened Components**  
   - Ensure all structural components, including the **RobDuino controller and battery**, are **firmly clipped into place**.  
   - Loose parts may cause mechanical instability, electrical disconnections, or unexpected behavior.  

**Battery Orientation and Connector Placement**  
   - The **battery should be correctly positioned** between the red cornered bricks, with the **connector facing the back of the robot**.  
   - Incorrect placement may make wiring difficult or even prevent proper power delivery.  

**Wheel Rotation and Friction Issues**  
   - Before finalizing assembly, **manually rotate the wheels** to ensure they spin **freely** without obstruction.  
   - If the wheels do not rotate smoothly, check for excessive tension in the axle or misaligned parts.  

By carefully addressing these points during assembly, you will **improve the robot’s stability, movement, and overall performance**, ensuring a successful build.
