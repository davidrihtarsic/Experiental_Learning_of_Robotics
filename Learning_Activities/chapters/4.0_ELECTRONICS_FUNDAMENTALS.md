Whether you're a curious hobbyist or aspiring engineer, learning the fundamentals of electronics is a crucial step towards understanding and building robots. Electronics is the backbone of robotic systems, providing the necessary control and communication between various components.

In this introduction, we'll explore the basic concepts of electronics that are essential for robotics. We'll cover topics such as circuits, components, sensors, actuators, and microcontrollers. By the end of this guide, you'll have a solid foundation to dive deeper into the world of robotics.

**Components**: Electronic components are the building blocks of circuits. Resistors control the flow of current, capacitors store electrical charge, and diodes allow current to flow in only one direction. Other components, like transistors and integrated circuits (ICs), provide amplification and complex functionalities. Familiarizing yourself with these components will enable you to construct and manipulate electronic circuits.

**Circuits**: At the heart of electronics lies the concept of circuits. A circuit is a path through which electric current flows. It consists of various components, such as resistors, capacitors, and diodes, connected by conductive wires. Understanding how circuits work is vital to designing and troubleshooting robotic systems. Central to understanding and designing these systems are the basic principles of electricity and electronics. In next chapters we will dive these principles, focusing on:

1. Ohm's Law,
2. Kirchhoff's Current Rule and
3. Kirchhoff's Voltage Rule,

and illustrates each with practical examples relevant to robotic device.

 Basic circuit components
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Resistors

### Diodes

### Power source

When it comes to powering an Arduino UNO controller for robotics projects, there are several options available depending on the specific requirements of your project. Here are some common power supply options:

1. USB Cable: The simplest and most common way to power an Arduino UNO is through a USB cable connected to a computer or a USB power source, such as a wall adapter or power bank. This is convenient for testing and prototyping, but it may not be suitable for mobile or standalone robot applications.

2. External Power Supply: The Arduino UNO can also be powered by an external power supply connected to its power jack. The board accepts a voltage range of 7 to 12 volts. You can use a DC power adapter or a battery pack with the appropriate voltage rating. Make sure the power supply can provide enough current to meet the requirements of your project.

3. 9V Battery: Another option is to power the Arduino UNO using a 9V battery. You can connect the battery to the power jack or use a battery clip to connect it to the Vin (voltage input) and GND (ground) pins on the Arduino board. Keep in mind that a 9V battery may not provide sufficient power for more demanding robotic applications.

4. LiPo Battery: For mobile or portable robot projects, lithium polymer (LiPo) batteries are a popular choice. LiPo batteries provide higher energy density and can deliver the necessary current for driving motors and other power-hungry components. However, you will need additional circuitry, such as voltage regulators and protection circuits, to ensure proper voltage levels and prevent overcharging or over-discharging of the battery.

When choosing a power supply, consider the voltage and current requirements of your Arduino UNO and the peripherals connected to it, such as motors, sensors, and other components. Ensure that the power supply can provide enough current and voltage stability for your specific project needs.

Always prioritize safety when working with power supplies. Use appropriate connectors, check polarity, and follow proper wiring practices to prevent short circuits or damage to your Arduino UNO and other components.

#### Battery UPS power supply

We utilize Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) power supply units such as the one available on AliExpress (see [@fig:UPS_Power_Spply]). These UPS units are specifically employed for providing power to simple mobile robots. They offer a cost-effective solution, allowing us to ensure uninterrupted power supply to the robots' systems. The chosen UPS units from AliExpress are reliable and affordable, making them an ideal choice for our requirements.

![UPS power supply[^UPS_Power_Spply].](./slike/UPS_Power_Spply.png){#fig:UPS_Power_Spply}

[^UPS_Power_Spply]: Source: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005452676689.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.19.455b3926DHH1L4&algo_pvid=de392f56-63b1-4837-96de-e710e8a0eb9a&aem_p4p_detail=202311030140378048689945398110001719497&search_p4p_id=202311030140378048689945398110001719497_2

The UPS described in the provided schema ([@fig:Schematic_Aether_LI-M-3P-D_2023-11-03]) is designed in such a way that the output voltage is controlled by a resistor divider circuit consisting of resistors R7 and R9.

![Schematic of UPS[^schema_UPS_link].](./slike/Schematic_Aether_LI-M-3P-D_2023-11-03.png){#fig:Schematic_Aether_LI-M-3P-D_2023-11-03}

[^schema_UPS_link]: Source: https://oshwlab.com/xordata/aether-li-m-3p-d

In this UPS schema, the resistors R7 and R9 are chosen in a way that their ratio divides the voltage proportionally to achieve the desired output voltage. By adjusting the values of these resistors, the output voltage can be regulated.

In addition to the regular setup, we incorporated an extra switch between the BAT+ (battery positive) and R3 resistor in power supply system. This switch serves the purpose of powering off the UPS (uninterruptible power supply). This feature provides convenience as it allows us to easily turn off the mobile robot and put the UPS into charging mode. By using this switch, we can efficiently manage the power supply to the robot and ensure that the UPS is charged when not in use.

### Issues:

#### Arduino Uno does not run when disconnected from USB

Sometimes students notice that the Arduino Uno works only when connected to the USB cable, but does not run when powered from an external battery alone, even though the battery voltage is correct.

A common reason is a damaged 5V voltage regulator on the Arduino Uno board. If the regulator fails, the ATmega328 microcontroller does not receive the required 5V supply and therefore cannot execute the program.

**Quick fix**:
Connect the +5V output provided by the RobDuino module (screw terminal +5V) directly to the Arduinoâ€™s +5V pin header. This bypasses the faulty regulator and powers the microcontroller directly.

![Quick-fix in case of 5V regualtor failure.](./slike/QuickFix_Arduino_RobDuino_editable.png){#fig:QuickFix_Arduino_RobDuino_editable width=14cm}

**Permanent solution**:
Replace the defective 5V regulator on the Arduino Uno board. This restores normal operation and ensures the board can again be powered from batteries or an external power supply without relying on the USB port.



 Ohm's Law
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ohm's Law is a foundational principle in the field of electronics, stating the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in an electrical circuit. It is succinctly expressed as [@eq:ohms_law]:

$$ I = \frac{R}{V} ,$${#eq:ohms_law}

where: 

- I is the current flowing through the circuit (in amperes), and 
- V is the voltage across the circuit (in volts), 
- R is the resistance (in ohms).

**Practical Example in Robotics**:

![Example of tipical electrical scheme of robotic device with one degree of freedom.](./slike/RobDuino_Basics_Electronics.png){#fig:RobDuino_Basics_Electronics}

1. Consider a simple robotic arm that uses a DC motor for movement ([@fig:RobDuino_Basics_Electronics]). If the motor has a resistance of $20 \Omega$ and is connected to a 9V power supply, Ohm's Law can determine the current flowing through the motor:

$$ I_{motor} = \frac{9V}{10\Omega} = 450 mA . $${#eq:i_mot_cal}

Understanding this helps in selecting the right power source and ensuring that the motor and control electronics are compatible, preventing overheating and damage.

2. To apply Ohm's Law in calculating the current flowing through a light lamp with a power rating of 0.75W at a supply voltage of 9V, and connected to a digital output (D3), we start by understanding the relationship between power, voltage, and current. Ohm's Law is traditionally stated as [@eq:ohms_law], but we can also express electrical power (Pe) in terms of voltage and current as [@eq:electrical_power]:

$$ P_e = V I .$${#eq:electrical_power}

Since we are again interested in electrical current trough lamp we can fill in the data:

$$ I_{D3} = \frac{P_e}{V} = \frac{0.75W}{9V} = 83 mA .$${#eq:povwer_d3}

### Questions

1. Calculate electrical current trough resistor $R_1$ if the voltage across it is $U_{R_1}=7.2V$!
2. Calculate the current trough resistor $R_4$ if measured voltage potential on $A_0$ pin is $V_{A_0} = 2V$!



 Kirchhoff's Current Rule
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kirchhoff's Current Rule, also known as the first Kirchhoff ~~law~~ rule, states that the total current entering a junction in a circuit equals the total current leaving the junction. This law is based on the principle of conservation of charge and is expressed with [@eq:kcl]:

$$ I_{x_1} + I_{x_2} + ... = I_{y_1} + I_{y_2} + I_{y_3} + ... $${#eq:kcl}

where:

- electrical currents with index $I_x$ are entering currents and
- currents with index $I_y$ are leaving junction currents.

We will explain the Kirchhoff's current rule on the same example shown in [@fig:RobDuino_Basics_Electronics_KCL]

![Electrical sheme of robotic device.](./slike/RobDuino_Basics_Electronics.png){#fig:RobDuino_Basics_Electronics_KCL}

**Practical Example in Robotics**:

Imagine a robotic hand with multiple sensors (e.g., touch sensor and light sensor) connected to a single microcontroller. If the sensors draw 0.23 mA (when $SW_1$ is closed) and 1.0 mA, and they are all connected to the same power supply junction, the total current entering the junction is:

$$ I_{tot} = I_{tch} + I_{light} = 0.23mA + 1.0mA = 1.23mA $${#eq:i_tot}

This information is critical for designing the power distribution network of the robot, ensuring that the power supply can handle the total current draw.

### Questions

1. What is the total current of actuators (motor, light bulb, LEDs) when they are all on?
2. Current into input pin $A_0$ is approximately $I_{A_0} = 20 nA$. Compare this current to other two currents at the middle junction in the light sensor. Can it be ignored?



 Kirchhoff's Voltage Rule
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kirchhoff's Voltage Rule (KVR), or the second Kirchhoff rule, states that the sum of all electrical potential differences around any closed network (or loop) is zero. This law is grounded in the conservation of energy principle and is expressed wiht [@eq:kvl]

$$ +U_1 - U_2 + ... + U_n = 0 $${#eq:kvl}

where:

- voltage is positive if voltage potential increases in the selected direction (e.g. $U_1$)  and
- voltage is negative if voltage potential decreases in this direction (e.g. $U_2$).

**Practical Example in Robotics**:

![Scheme of robotic device.](./slike/RobDuino_Basics_Electronics.png){#fig:RobDuino_Basics_Electronics_kvl}

Consider a circuit in a robotic device that includes an LED circuit as a signal light (e.g., $D_0 \rightarrow R_1 \rightarrow LED_1 \rightarrow D_1$. If we assume that across output pins $D1$ and $D_0$ is a positive voltage potential difference $U_{(D_1-D_0)} = 9V$, according to KVR, we can write an [@eq:kvl_ex1] for this loop:

$$ U_{(D_1-D_0)} - U_{R_1} - U_{LED_1} = 0V $${#eq:kvl_ex1}

Rearranging the [@eq:kvl_ex1] we can calculate the voltage across resistor $R_1$:

$$ U_{R_1} = U_{(D_1-D_0)} - U_{LED_1} = 9V-1.8V=7.2V$${#eq:u_res_1}

This ensures that the energy supplied by the controller is completely used by the resistor and led. Kirchhoff's voltage rule is instrumental in analyzing and designing circuits for energy efficiency and proper component operation in robotics.

Understanding the basic principles of electricity and electronics, epitomized by Ohm's Law and Kirchhoff's rules, is crucial for anyone venturing into robotics. These principles not only guide the design and analysis of robotic systems but also ensure their safe and efficient operation. By applying these laws, we can predict how circuits will behave under various conditions, optimize energy consumption, and troubleshoot potential issues, laying the groundwork for more advanced explorations into the electrifying world of robotics.

### Questions

1. Calculate the voltage across resistor $R_2$ when voltage potencial of $V_{D0}=0V$ and voltage potencial of $V_{D1}=9V$!
2. What is the voltage across resistor $R_3$ if we measured voltage potencial $V_{A_0}=2V$ at the input pin $A_0$?



 Digital output
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On an Arduino Uno board, a digital output is a pin that can be used to output a digital signal, which can be either high (5 volts) or low (0 volts). Digital outputs are useful for controlling devices that are either on or off, such as LEDs, motors, and relays.

To use a digital output on an Arduino Uno board, you will need to specify which pin you want to use as an output in your code. You can do this using the pinMode function, which takes two arguments: the pin number and the mode (OUTPUT or INPUT). For example, the following code sets digital pin 13 as an output:

```C++
pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
```

Once you have set a pin as an output, you can use the digitalWrite function to set the pin to either a high or low state. For example, the following code sets digital pin 13 to a high state:

```C++
digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
```
